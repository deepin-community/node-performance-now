Description: Implements performance.now (based on process.hrtime)
 Modern browsers have a `window.performance` object with - among others - a
 `now` method which gives time in milliseconds, but with sub-millisecond
 precision. This module offers the same function based on the Node.js native
 `process.hrtime` function.
 .
 Using `process.hrtime` means that the reported time will be monotonically
 increasing, and not subject to clock-drift.
 .
 This library is a dependency of request, the simplest way possible to make
 http calls.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
